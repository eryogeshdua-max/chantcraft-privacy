    <h1>Privacy Policy for ChantCraft</h1>
    <div class="updated">Last Updated: December 25, 2025</div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>ChantCraft – Japp Counter</strong> ("we," "our," or "us").
      We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe, secure
      environment for your spiritual practice. This Privacy Policy explains how
      we handle your data when you use our mobile application.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>In Short:</strong> We prioritize your privacy. We do not sell your
      data, we do not record your voice, and we store the majority of your
      progress locally on your device.
    </div>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect &amp; How We Use It</h2>
    <p>
      We adhere to data minimization principles. We only collect the data
      necessary for the App’s functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>A. Data Stored Locally (On Your Device)</h3>
    <p>
      The following data is stored securely on your device and is not
      automatically uploaded to our servers unless you choose to back it up (if
      applicable) or interact with online features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App Progress:</strong> Chanting counts, current levels, unlocked gems, and streaks.</li>
      <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> App settings, customizations, and background choices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Data Processed for Authentication &amp; Purchases</h3>
    <p>
      To manage your subscription and verify unique users without collecting
      personal identities, we utilize:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> We use anonymous authentication
        tokens and device UUIDs to securely manage your session. We do not
        collect your name, email address, or phone number.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Purchase Tokens:</strong> If you purchase a subscription or item,
        we process verification tokens provided by Google Play Billing to validate
        the transaction. We do not have access to your credit card or banking
        details.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sensitive Permissions &amp; Feature Usage</h2>
    <p>Google Play requires explicit explanations for sensitive permissions.</p>

    <h3>Microphone (Record Audio)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage:</strong> Used strictly for the "Voice Mode" feature to
        detect chanting via speech-to-text analysis.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Privacy Guarantee:</strong> Audio is processed in real-time within
        the device's volatile memory (RAM). We do not record, save, store, or
        transmit your voice audio to any external server. Once chanting is
        detected, the audio data is immediately discarded.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Physical Activity / Sensors (Proximity &amp; Light)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage:</strong> Used for "Pocket Mode" to turn off the screen or
        detect handling during practice to save battery.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Privacy Guarantee:</strong> Sensor data is processed locally and
        never leaves your device.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Storage (Read/Write)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage:</strong> Required to save your progress, user settings, and
        custom background images.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We utilize trusted third-party service providers to facilitate basic app
      functions. These providers have their own privacy policies which adhere to
      strict data protection standards.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> Used for secure, anonymous authentication.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> Used for handling in-app purchases and subscriptions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We DO NOT use:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advertising SDKs (e.g., AdMob)</li>
      <li>Marketing Analytics</li>
      <li>Social Media Trackers</li>
      <li>Location Tracking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Data:</strong> You have full control. You can delete your
        local progress at any time by clearing the app data or uninstalling the
        App.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Server Data:</strong> Because our authentication is anonymous, we
        do not hold a permanent profile linked to your real-world identity.
        Verification tokens on our servers are retained only as long as necessary
        to validate active subscriptions or prevent fraud, and are deleted
        automatically after 180 days of inactivity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our App is designed to be family-friendly. We comply with the Children’s
      Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Google Play Families Policy.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</li>
      <li>The App does not contain interest-based advertising or external links unsuitable for children.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or
      for legal reasons. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page indicates
      when the latest revisions were made. We advise you to review this page
      periodically.
    </p>
